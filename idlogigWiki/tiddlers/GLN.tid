*''__Company Prefix__'' is the globally unique number issued to your company by GS1 USÂ® or another GS1 Member Organization. GS1 Company Prefixes are assigned to companies in varying lengths. Some GS1 US members may have a prefix certificate that shows only a U.P.C. Company Prefix (formerly a UCC Company Prefix). A U.P.C. ''//Company Prefix must be converted to a GS1 Company Prefix for use in the GLN. This is accomplished by adding a zero to the front of the U.P.C. Company Prefix//''



*''__The Location Reference number__'' is assigned by you, the holder of the GS1 Company Prefix, to identify a location or a legal function within your company. The Location Reference varies in length as a function of the GS1 Company Prefix length. //''Note that the combined length of the GS1 Company Prefix and Location Reference is always 12 digits.''//


*__''The Check Digit''__ is a calculated one-digit number used to validate data integrity. To understand how this digit is calculated, refer to [[www.gs1us.org/checkdig]]
